If it\u2019s very cold, though, you might want to go inside or you\u2019ll catch your death. This doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll actually die if you go outside\u2014just that you might get a very serious cold. You can use this phrase as a warning, telling someone to \u201cdress warm or you\u2019ll catch your death!\u201d"},{day:"2",phrase:"Cold snap",definition:"Autumn and winter are beautiful seasons, but they are also the time when you might experience a cold snap. A cold snap is very sudden cold weather that passes as quickly as it appears. Think of snapping your fingers: quick, short and sudden."},{day:"3",phrase:"Baby, it\u2019s cold outside",definition:"The phrase \u201cBaby, it\u2019s cold outside\u201d is not used as often as the rest of the phrases on this list. You should only use it with friends, because the word \u201cbaby\u201d is a term of endearment (a nickname you use with someone close to you, like \u201cdear\u201d or \u201choney\u201d). It comes from the song by the same name: \u201cBaby It\u2019s Cold Outside.\u201d This phrase can be used when someone tells you to go outside and you don\u2019t want to: \u201cBut I don\u2019t want to go\u2026 baby, it\u2019s cold outside!\u201d"},{day:"4",phrase:"Bundle up",definition:"Before you can face the cold outside, you have to bundle up, which means to get dressed warmly. A bundle is a tightly wrapped package, so bundling up is like wrapping yourself in warm clothes or blankets like a package!"},{day:"5",phrase:"Blanket of snow",definition:"In the winter, you probably use a blanket when you sleep. It\u2019s a thick cloth covering that you put over yourself to keep warm. When snow falls and sticks to the ground, it looks like a blanket of snow is covering the earth."},{day:"6",phrase:"Jack Frost nipping at your nose",definition:"You can find this expression in a classic Christmas song by Nat King Cole, \u201cChestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire,\u201d which you can listen to here. If winter were a person, it would be Jack Frost. \u201cFrost\u201d is the thin layer of ice that covers surfaces when it gets very cold\u2014usually seen on grass. Jack Frost (also called \u201cOld Man Winter\u201d) is an old character who goes around and nips (gently bites) at people\u2019s noses and toes during winter. So when Jack Frost is nipping at your nose, you feel a biting cold on your face."},{day:"7",phrase:"Dead of winter",definition:"During winter, not many things grow. Flowers and grass are covered by the snow and trees lose their leaves. The coldest, darkest time of winter is known as the dead of winter. Even if you like winter, this cold time is not a positive experience. So you might say, \u201cThe only thing I want to do in the dead of winter is stay indoors and drink hot chocolate.\u201d"},{day:"8",phrase:"Snowed in",definition:"When it snows a lot, the snow can pile up high outside your house. If you can\u2019t even open your door because of the snow, that means you are snowed in. Good luck getting out of a house that\u2019s snowed in!"},{day:"9",phrase:"To cozy up to someone",definition:"Winter is a perfect time to get close to your loved ones and cuddle under a blanket. This is called to cozy up to someone for warmth. There is another meaning to the phrase, which isn\u2019t as nice: to try to get closer to someone by being extra nice and friendly. In this meaning, you\u2019re usually extra friendly because you want something from the other person. For example, when a car salesman tries to cozy up to you, he does so to sell you a more expensive car."},{day:"10",phrase:"Season\u2019s greetings",definition:"The winter months might be cold and dark, but they are full of festivities and holidays. In December, around or during Christmas time, saying \u201cSeason\u2019s greetings!\u201d is a way to wish someone a happy holiday."},{day:"11",phrase:"Brace yourself, winter is coming",definition:"Even if you don\u2019t watch the popular TV show \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d you\u2019ve probably heard of it (or the books), or seen an advertisement for the show. One of these ads says \u201cBrace yourself, winter is coming.\u201d \u201cBrace yourself\u201d means \u201cprepare yourself,\u201d so this saying means you should get ready for winter. You can use the phrase to talk about anything unpleasant that is on the way. For example, \u201cBrace yourself, the final exam is coming.\u201d"},{day:"12",phrase:"Snowed under",definition:"When you have so much work that you don\u2019t even know where to start, you are snowed under. Imagine your work is like snow, and you have so much surrounding you that you can\u2019t even move! You can use this idiom to talk about work, school or anything else. For example: \u201cI\u2019d love to go shopping with you, but I\u2019m snowed under with housework.\u201d"},{day:"13",phrase:"Put something on ice",definition:"Putting something on ice means delaying or pausing it until later. The idiom comes from the way you put certain foods (like meat) on ice to keep them fresh until you want to use them. This phrase is used most often when talking about ideas, tasks or projects. For example, at work you might hear: \u201cLet\u2019s put this project on ice until we hire more people to work on it.\u201d"},{day:"14",phrase:"Not a snowball\u2019s chance in hell",definition:"Usually, hell is known as a place that is extremely hot and fiery. A snowball in hell would melt right away! So when something has \u201ca snowball\u2019s chance in hell,\u201d it has absolutely no chance at all of happening. For example, someone who doesn\u2019t know how to swim probably has \u201ca snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d of being an Olympic swimmer. Adding \u201cnot\u201d before the idiom makes it even more negative, showing that there\u2019s even less of a chance. To keep your sentence grammatically correct, you\u2019ll have to add the word \u201chave/has\u201d after \u201cdoes not/doesn\u2019t,\u201d like this: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a snowball\u2019s chance in hell of passing the class; he\u2019s failed every exam this semester!\u201d \u201cNot a snowball\u2019s chance in hell\u201d can also be used alone as a response that means \u201cNo way!\u201d For example, if someone asks you, \u201cAre you going to Cindy\u2019s holiday party, even though she started dating your ex-boyfriend?\u201d you can respond, \u201cNot a snowball\u2019s chance in hell!\u201d"},{day:"15",phrase:"When hell freezes over",definition:"When hell freezes over is another idiom that refers to how hot hell is. Put simply, the phrase means \u201cnever.\u201d The idea is that hell will never ever freeze. So if I say \u201cI\u2019ll go on a date with you when hell freezes over,\u201d that means that I\u2019ll probably never go on a date with you\u2014since the chances of hell freezing are very, very low."},{day:"16",phrase:"Break the ice",definition:"Meeting new people is easier if you know how to break the ice. Breaking the ice, or using an ice breaker, is a way to start a conversation with someone. Sometimes when people don\u2019t know each other, the atmosphere can be cold and unwelcoming (that\u2019s the \u201cice\u201d) until something happens to relax them (\u201cbreaking the ice\u201d). You can \u201cbreak the ice\u201d by giving someone a compliment, or just by giving them a nice smile. Anything that gets people talking or makes them more relaxed is a good ice breaker. \u201cTo break the ice\u201d can also mean to be the first to do something. "},{day:"17",phrase:"To leave someone out in the cold",definition:"If you don\u2019t let someone join an activity or a group, that\u2019s like closing the door and leaving them outside in winter: It leaves them out in the cold. For example, \u201cTony was left out in the cold when his co-workers all went out to lunch without him.\u201d"},{day:"18",phrase:"Walking on thin ice",definition:"It\u2019s dangerous to walk on thin ice because it can break at any moment and you can fall through. That\u2019s why the idiom walking on thin ice means to be in a risky situation that can easily go bad. For example, if you miss a lot of days of school, you might be walking on thin ice. Missing an exam or homework assignment might mean trouble for you."},{day:"19",phrase:"Tip of the iceberg",definition:"Icebergs are huge chunks of ice that float in waters in very cold areas of the world. What you see above the water is just a tiny part of the full iceberg, since most of it is underwater. When you say something is the tip of the iceberg, you\u2019re saying it\u2019s just a small part of something much bigger and mostly unseen. This usually has a negative meaning, and is used to describe problems. For example, \u201cThe homeless people you see in this homeless shelter are just the tip of the iceberg\u2014there are many others living out in the streets.\u201d"},{day:"20",phrase:"Cold hands, warm heart",definition:"Just because your hands are cold, that doesn\u2019t mean you are a cold person. Similarly, just because you don\u2019t show emotion, that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t feel it! Cold hands, warm heart means that people who are cold on the outside might be warm and caring inside. For example: \u201cShe never cries, but you can tell she cares a lot. She has cold hands but a warm heart.\u201d Now that you\u2019re all bundled up from the cold weather with sayings, phrases and idioms, you\u2019re ready to face the winter!"},{day:"21",phrase:"The snowball effect",definition:"A situation or problem when the consequences grow at a faster rate over time. \u201cThe beginning popularity of applications for the iPhone and Android created a snowball effect and now there is an endless number of apps for smartphones.\u201d"},{day:"22",phrase:"To get cold feet",definition:"To lose courage; to suddenly become too nervous to do something important (like giving a speech, getting married, doing something adventurous). \u201cSarah\u2019s piano recital was last weekend. Unfortunately, she got cold feet and she didn\u2019t perform.\u201d"},{day:"23",phrase:"The cold shoulder",definition:"To reject someone; to not speak to someone. \u201cLaura\u2019s giving me the cold shoulder. I guess she\u2019s still mad that I forgot her birthday last week.\u201d"},{day:"24",phrase:"A snow day",definition:"(noun phrase) \u2013 a day at home after the cancellation of school for children due to snow, ice, or very cold weather. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll get enough snow to have a snow day tomorrow?\u201d"},{day:"25",phrase:"To hibernate",definition:"(verb) \u2013 to spend the winter dormant (for example, many animals hibernate during the winter months); to withdraw or be in seclusion. \u201cThe days are so short and cold during the winter; I just prefer to hibernate at home rather than be outside.\u201d"},{day:"26",phrase:"Frigid",definition:"(adjective) \u2013 extremely cold weather/temperatures. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to wear warm clothes to school! It\u2019s frigid this morning.\u201d"},{day:"27",phrase:"Slushy",definition:" (adjective) \u2013 from the noun slush, which means partly melted snow. \u201cUgh, this time of year is so ugly. I\u2019d would prefer colder temperatures to have white snow instead of this slushy mess!\u201d"},{day:"28",phrase:"Comfort food",definition:"(noun phrase) \u2013 food that is simple and gives us a feeling of warmth or reminds us of home. \u201cWhen I\u2019m sick, the only thing I want is some of my mom\u2019s comfort food, like her delicious chicken soup.\u201d"},{day:"29",phrase:"Freeze one\u2019s blood",definition:"Fill one with feelings of fear or horror"},{day:"30",phrase:"Freeze someone out",definition:"isolate someone socially"},{day:"31",phrase:"Freeze someone\u2019s wages",definition:"keep someone\u2019s pay at its current level"}],Y=new Date,Q=["January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August","September","October","November","December"][Y.getMonth()],M=Y.getDate(),R=Y.getFullYear(),G=function(e){function t(){return Object(k.a)(this,t),Object(E.a)(this,Object(j.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(C.a)(t,e),Object(_.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){for(var e={phrase:"Something went wrong",definition:"Come back later!"},t=1;t<V.length;t++)V[t].day==M&&(e.phrase=V[t].phrase,e.definition=V[t].definition);return n.a.createElement("div",{className:q.a.OnePhraseADay},n.a.createElement("h3",null,"Phrase of The Day - ",Q," ",M,", ",R),n.a.createElement("div",{className:q.a.Phrase,style:{background:"linear-gradient(#f0e6e622, #f0e6e611), url(".concat(J.a,") no-repeat center"),backgroundSize:"cover"}},n.a.createElement("h4",null,e.phrase),n.a.createElement("h5",null,e.definition)),n.a.createElement("p",null,"Resources are found ",n.a.createElement("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://www.fluentu.com/blog/english/winter-phrases/"},"here")," and ",n.a.createElement("a",{target:"_blank",href:"https://www.speakconfidentenglish.com/english-winter-idioms/"},"here"),"!"))}}]),t}(o.Component),U=a(26),K=a(16),X=a.n(K),Z=a(49),$=a.n(Z),ee=function(e){var t="white";switch(e.pos){case 0:t="#6fa16a";break;case 1:t="#e68a7a";break;case 2:t="#e6c97a";break;case 3:t="#8fa3da";break;default:t="white"}return n.a.createElement("div",{className:$.a.AnswerBox,style:{backgroundColor:t},onClick:e.clicked},n.a.createElement("p",null,e.choice))},te=function e(t,a,o){Object(k.a)(this,e),this.word=t,this.definition=a,this.wrongAnswers=o},ae=[new te("brisk","Quick, lively, bracing, and refreshing.
