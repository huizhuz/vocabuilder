This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
Here are some other stuff I used:
1. React-router
2. Axios
3. Firebase
4. Font-awesome
5. Unsplash for pretty pictures
6. Other English learning resources

## Intention

What I want to achieve from creating this app is to combine my background as a language educator and a frontend developer. This is designed as a language learning tool and should be expanded and maintained throughout time.

## Functions

This app has three major functionalities: One phrase a day, Vocabulary quiz, and Contact me.

One phrase a day: On this page, you will see one phrase related to Halloween each day through the rest of October. For now I only added phrases from Oct 18 to Oct 31. 

Vocabulary quiz: On this page, you will be prompted to choose the most relevant word from 4 options. If the answer is correct, a new one will show untill we run out of words. This process can be incredibily fast since we only have 4 words added for the moment. New words will continue to be added. 

Contact me: The form information will be sent to firebase.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
