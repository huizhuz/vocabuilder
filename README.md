This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
Here are some other stuff I used:
1. React-router
2. Axios
3. Firebase
4. Font-awesome
5. Unsplash for pretty pictures
6. Other English learning resources

## Intention

What I want to achieve from creating this app is to combine my background as a language educator and a frontend developer. This is designed as a language learning tool and should be expanded and maintained throughout time.

## Functions

This app has three major functionalities: One phrase a day, Vocabulary quiz, and Contact me.

One phrase a day: On this page, you will see one phrase related to Halloween each day through the rest of October. For now I only added phrases from Oct 18 to Oct 31. 

Vocabulary quiz: On this page, you will be prompted to choose the most relevant word from 4 options. If the answer is correct, a new one will show untill we run out of words. This process can be incredibily fast since we only have 4 words added for the moment. New words will continue to be added. 

Contact me: The form information will be sent to firebase.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
